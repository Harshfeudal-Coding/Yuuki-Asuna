# Yuuki Asuna Discord Bot
 The C++ Discord bot, developed by Harshfeudal#0001. <br />
 
 **Note:**
- Yuuki Asuna#8388 avatar was collected from the Internet. If it’s your art the please DM me on Discord for imagine source.
- This respiratory is developed using Visual Studio 2022, `x64` and `Release` version. 
- If you want to use it, just download it and open the `.sln` file.

## Attention
- This respiratory is under-construction! I'll update it as soon as possible :>
- It's not too good to code a Discord Bot using C++ language, but I hope I can develop a multipurpose bot one like the way I do in JavaScript (no I don't pretty like JS at all :<)
 
 ### Support me
 - Please leave me a star if you like it :> Thank you!
 - You can encourage me by joining my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/6Faaqhaqjs) if you prefer too, since the server is kindly dead, not the same as before :(
 - You can probably help me to develop this project too by DM me on my [Discord profile (Harshfeudal#0001)](https://discord.com/users/622450109317251088)

### Special thanks
I’d glad to thanks [Dpp Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dpp) and everyone in there for helping me in making this bot. Without them, the bot may not be well-developed and result a crash.
